### Food Mood Project
View Here: https://gistewart.github.io/FoodMoodProject/

### Project Goal
A user inputs a specific food (or select a preset food) and creates a page with various content related to that food such as images, gifs, restaurant recommendations, recipes, fun facts, and nutrition information.  This app will help food enthusiasts get inspired to cook a new dish or simply provide a little entertainment for anyone with food on their mind.
